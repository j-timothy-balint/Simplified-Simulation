# Simplified Simulation
 Contains all the code to actually perform simplified simulation. To use this code, you need to download the [Parameterized Action Representation](https://github.com/GAIA-GMU/PAR) and put that project in the same directory. 
 
### Requirements
 1. The Parameterized Action Representation [Parameterized Action Representation](https://github.com/GAIA-GMU/PAR) which has its own set of requirements.
 
### Minimal Usage
Move PAR into the main directory. Ensure that PAR has been correctly compiled. Run the main program, and it will generate the narrative table and connections for the castle story.
